    <h1>5th Finger Chicken Noodle Soup</h1>

      Dedicated to my early friend Dane Fitzgerald Marks, who, when asked what he would choose if he could have unlimited liquid come from each of his fingers, chose to subvert expectations and pick five fingers of chicken noodle soup…<br><br>
      Five finger chicken noodle soup…<br>
      Fifth finger chicken noodle soup.

      In a buried world irrecoverable today, in the most productive peppercorn farm on Earth, a field of plants mutated into a highly addictive stimulant. People all over the globe became absolutely wired on the stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this should have been stopped almost immediately—you can’t have entire countries on uppers all the time. That should’ve been the case, but people on this new pepper attained immense energy. One packet felt like you had gotten the most refreshing sleep of your life and awoke to being four again on Christmas Day, with a puppy barking downstairs no less.
    </p>

      Officials were wise to its spread, but as productivity skyrocketed, they turned the other cheek. With the strength of these mighty labor stallions, the upper tiers of society stood to profit. Scientists would attempt to publish papers—calls for caution against pepper—calls that were answered with silencers and hot lead.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the blink of an eye, a new societal norm—nay, expectation—had been ushered in. Pepper was the air people breathed, and it was hard to argue against it; wherever one's eye turned they saw mass advancements being achieved. Modern medicine progressed faster than ever. With the demand for pepper, the agricultural industry boomed; advancements made food supplies multiply and bring the population cap with them.

      Humanity needed more room to occupy. Cities soared to the sky with monuments spearing the clouds as if to taunt the heavens. You were likely to spend your entire life without touching the ground. Trains and buses intertwined between the spires like a web ever so eloquently woven by a spider. A new revolution was upon the world—society was all shook up like a cool can of Mr. Pibb, and brother, it was 'bouta burst.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fifty-odd years later, in one of these such cities, Kernel City, a man drenched in sweat and rags walked a rebar cage bridge. His bony legs failed to carry him; his frail body collapsed into the cool metal bars. He barely split his pale eyelids, and it appeared to him that his pinky finger was dripping with rich, nourishing chicken noodle soup. He pressed the delicacy to his lips. His heart started beating with excitement from how wonderful the taste was. It reminded him of his mother’s cooking—in fact, his mother was there, standing on the very same bridge above him. He reached out to her as she seemed to melt into the bars. The man’s hand quickly redirected its course, grasping at his chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      He fell to the side, dead, to the most common killer of the decade: pepper withdrawals. A stranger clad in black walked by; they placed a finger on his carotid artery and felt nothing. They stared at the man’s dismembered pinky on the ground and the warm blood on his mouth. Their eyes carried strain where you’d expect to find shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      They shut the man's eyelids and reached into his pockets, finding a ten-cent coin and a few empty packets of pepper. The man lay there alone, with hundreds of people passing him by. Our shadowy figure would pass many like the man that day.
    </p>

      The platforms they lived on stretched for miles. Small windows lined the cityscape; they almost seemed to loop infinitely like a fractal. Two-story-tall levels were stacked on top of each other like flapjacks. The sky shone dark with concrete. The patter of footsteps from the masses above was an ever-present noise, accompanied by the electrical hums of neon street signs and the chirps of frequent nests of cameras. They set the soundtrack for life down there in the slums.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stranger made it to a rickety little noodle stand with an apartment above it. An ever-so-familiar sign hung above: <em>“Elysium Noodles.”</em>
