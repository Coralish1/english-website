	<h1>About the author</h1>
    <p> Coral Compact Disc Lastname (born unfortunately) has written for English class, journalism class, and probably a few comedy bits. It lives in Colorado and is known for many works such as The Giver Essay, The Incomprehensible Tale of a Man Named Jeremy, The Best Story Ever Written, and of course, Peppa Packet and Peppa Packet Reprise.<br><br>

Lastname never found itself with more than a C in English. As famed journalist Neo once wrote, “Lastname lives on a day-to-day basis, waking up and seeing where the day takes it. Sometimes it’s with its friends to their favorite hangout spot — a concrete tunnel.”<br><br>

Lastname’s work is plagued with a sense of irony overshadowing the goals of its papers. The reason for this is not public knowledge. Apparently, the neurologist said they don’t treat people under 18.<br><br>

When we asked its associate, Dane Marks, for comment, he said:
“The fridge was running, and it ran too fast. It got away, and it all went downhill from there.”

He added, “And they ran out of Peppa.”<br><br>

When we reached out to Lastname directly for comment, it said:
“Dude, fuck are you on about my writing is totally bitchin’ dude.”<br><br>
