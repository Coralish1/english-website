	<h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>		Once upon a time there was an English class, but I failed that one. Once upon a few <br>months later there was a creative writing class. And in this class I faced many challenges <br>like doing the work, may my polished poetry be finished in our hearts. If I like haddd to say how I <br>specifically grew in my craft this quarter I'd say something about pepper cause I'm a little <br>challenged but I probably also got better at using descriptive language. To be a writer? Shit twin. <br>That just means to write some stuff, doesn't it? Writing gives me some straight fire to look back <br>on when the severe memory loss that I stay getting refused medical care for kicks in. it kinda <br>only costs me time and like a little bit of paper. I'm pretty impressed that I managed to not get <br>bored of talking about pepper to the same two people for a month, youâ€™d think at some point that <br>would kick in. if I had to say my favorite thing about word count requirements? They probably <br>make you think harder about the language you use while writing them. And to all a year <br>peppered with interesting things and to all a good night.<br>
